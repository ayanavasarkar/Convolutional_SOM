# Convolutional_Self-Organising-Maps

A code wise implementation of Convolutional Self-Organising maps

Dataset used - MNIST dataset. (Please download it from the original website - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

Main code file - final_SOM.py

# Steps to follow - 

1) python final_SOM.py
2) python visWeights.py som.npz 1 10 10 28 3
3) Finally view the w.png file to observe the results
